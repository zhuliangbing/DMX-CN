About the modules-external directory
------------------------------------

This is where you develop your own DeepaMehta plugins.

Create a new directory here for each plugin.
Every time you build your plugin it gets automatically (re)deployed.

Use the modules-external directory when you've build DeepaMehta from source
and want develop 3rd-party plugins and DeepaMehta standard plugins in parallel.
